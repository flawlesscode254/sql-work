# SQL-exercise
the table named "sales", with "cust"\"prod"\"quant"\"state"\"day"\"month"\"year"

* [x] For each customer, compute the minimum and maximum sales quantities along with:
  * [x] the corresponding products (purchased), 
  * [x] dates (i.e., dates of those minimum and maximum sales quantities)
  * [x] the states in which the sale transactions took place. 
    * [x] If there are >1 occurrences of the min or max, display all.
    * [x] For the same customer, compute the average sales quantity.

* [x] For each of the 12 months (regardless of the year): 
  * [x] find the most “popular” 
  * [x] least “popular” products (those products with most and least total sales quantities) 
  * [x] the corresponding total sales quantities (i.e., SUMs).

* [x] For each product:
  * [x] find the “most favorable” month (when most amount of the product was sold) 
  * [x] the “least favorable” month (when the least amount of the product was sold).

* [x] Show for each customer and product combination:
  * [x] the average sales quantities for 4 quarters 
  * [x] Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 (in four separate columns) 
    * [x] – Q1 being the first 3 months of the year (Jan, Feb & Mar)
    * [x] Q2 the next 3 months (Apr, May & Jun), and so on 
    * [x] – ignore the YEAR component of the dates (i.e., 3/11/2001 is considered the same date as 3/11/2002,  * [x] Also compute the average for the “whole” year (again ignoring the YEAR component
      * [x] meaning simply compute AVG) along with the total quantities (SUM) and the counts (COUNT).
